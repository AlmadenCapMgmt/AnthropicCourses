# Anthropic courses

Welcome to Anthropic's educational courses. This repository currently contains four courses.  We suggest completing the courses in the following order:

1. [Anthropic API fundamentals course](./anthropic_api_fundamentals/README.md) - teaches the essentials of working with the Claude SDK: getting an API key, working with model parameters, writing multimodal prompts, streaming responses, etc.
2. [Prompt engineering interactive tutorial](./prompt_engineering_interactive_tutorial/README.md) - a comprehensive step-by-step guide to key prompting techniques

  - [Google Vertex version](https://github.com/anthropics/courses/tree/vertex/real_world_prompting)

3. [Real world prompting course](./real_world_prompting/README.md) - learn how to incorporate prompting techniques into complex, real world prompts
4. [Writing prompt evaluations course](./evaluations/README.md) - learn how to write production prompt evaluations to measure the quality of your prompts.
5. [Tool use course](./tool_use/README.md) - teaches everything you need to know to implement tool use successfully in your workflows with Claude.

**Please note that these courses often favor our lowest-cost model, Claude 3 Haiku, to keep API costs down for students following along with the materials. Feel free to use other Claude models if you prefer. **
